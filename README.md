# auto-gas
auto-gas is an EthOS application that manages users gas to ensure a good user experience with compatible mobile devices

### MVP
1. UI to power up your wallet with Warpcore  
2. Hourly chron job to check wallet balances, and offer a tx Speed => ETH, to top up the users ETH balance with speed when necessary.

### V1
Shift to fully automated system  
  
Ideas:  
Utilize Gnosis  
A user locks Warpcore to vault  
Chron job continues to check balances and triggers the vault to top-up    
Vault converts Speed to ETH  
Drip feeds to users EthOS wallet
